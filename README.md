Premier League Match Prediction ⚽
Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of Premier League matches using machine learning. By analyzing historical match data and applying feature engineering, the model provides insights into match results such as wins, losses, and draws.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling of match details such as venue, opponent, and date.
Feature Engineering: Adds features like venue codes, opponent codes, match timing, and day of the week for better prediction accuracy.
Model Training: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier for predicting match outcomes.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy and precision scores for model evaluation.
Rolling Averages: Implements rolling averages for team statistics (goals, shots, etc.) to improve predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model training and evaluation.
Pandas & NumPy: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
How It Works
Data Preparation:
The dataset is processed to create features such as venue_code, opp_code, hour, and day_code. The target variable indicates whether the match was won (W -> 1, others -> 0).

Model Training:

The Random Forest model is trained using historical match data up to 2023.
Key predictors include venue, opponent, match hour, and day of the week.
Evaluation:

Predictions are made on the test set (2024 matches).
Accuracy and precision scores are calculated to evaluate model performance.
Results
Accuracy Score: Provides the overall correctness of the model.
Precision Score: Highlights the model’s ability to predict wins correctly.
Confusion Matrix: Gives detailed insight into actual vs. predicted outcomes.
