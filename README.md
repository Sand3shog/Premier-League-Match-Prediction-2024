# Premier-League-Match-Prediction-2024
A comprehensive machine learning project predicting Premier League match outcomes. Leverages historical data, feature engineering, Random Forest classification, and evaluation metrics to forecast match results. Ideal for football enthusiasts and data analysts. âš½ðŸ“Š

# Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of Premier League matches using machine learning. By analyzing historical match data and applying feature engineering, the model provides insights into match results such as wins, losses, and draws.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling of match details such as venue, opponent, and date.

Feature Engineering: Adds features like venue codes, opponent codes, match timing, and day of the week for better prediction accuracy.

Model Training: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier for predicting match outcomes.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy and precision scores for model evaluation.

Rolling Averages: Implements rolling averages for team statistics (goals, shots, etc.) to improve predictions.

# How It Works
Data Preparation:
The dataset is processed to create features such as venue_code, opp_code, hour, and day_code. The target variable indicates whether the match was won (W -> 1, others -> 0).

Model Training:
The Random Forest model is trained using historical match data up to 2023.
Key predictors include venue, opponent, match hour, and day of the week.

Evaluation:
Predictions are made on the test set (2024 matches).
Accuracy and precision scores are calculated to evaluate model performance.

# Results
Accuracy Score: Provides the overall correctness of the model.
Precision Score: Highlights the modelâ€™s ability to predict wins correctly.
Confusion Matrix: Gives detailed insight into actual vs. predicted outcomes.

# Future Enhancements
Incorporate additional features like player statistics, injuries, and team form.
Experiment with advanced models such as Gradient Boosting or neural networks.
Deploy as a web application for real-time match predictions.
